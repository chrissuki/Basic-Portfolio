		<p> My name is Chris Hasler, and I am currently looking for a job in web development. I currently manaage both rental properties and farm lands with my father, which we have been able to expand from one farm properties to seven revenue streams. We have been lucky to create a considerable about of passive income through government programs and rental market.   

		

		In my spare time I build furniture with my wife, play violin and enjoying playing sports like beach volleyball.
